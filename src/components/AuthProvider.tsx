/**
 * Provides the authentication session.
 *
 * The provider observes; it does not authenticate. Sign-in, sign-up and password
 * changes go through `@/lib/auth/actions`, and the resulting session arrives here
 * as a change from the provider. That split matters, because the provider cannot
 * be the only thing that knows about a session — a sign-in that happened in
 * another tab, or a recovery link that established a session before this
 * component mounted, has to be picked up too.
 *
 * The initial state is `loading`, not `anonymous`, and the distinction is
 * load-bearing. A persisted session is read asynchronously, so rendering
 * "anonymous" first would show a signed-out interface for a moment before
 * correcting itself — and would bounce a signed-in user to the login page every
 * time they reloaded, which is the kind of bug that trains people to distrust
 * the app.
